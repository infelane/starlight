# Astrohack
Some material for the [Astrohack hackathon](https://astrohack.org/hackathon/).

Instructions on how to [request a VSC account](VSC-ACCOUNT-HOWTO.md) to access the HPC infrastructure used during the Astrohack.

We provide two alternatives to install TensorFlow, either
* an [install from scratch](INSTALL.md) that lets you customize your environment, or
* a ["quick install"](QUICK_INSTALL.md) from pre-defined environments.
